A high-performance CLI tool developed to handle structured data management through Object-Oriented Programming. This system bridges the gap between local JSON storage and physical data representation via QR codes.

---

## 🚀 Technical Highlights
- **Persistent Storage**: Custom JSON serialization logic for reliable data recovery and reuse.
- **Cryptographic IDs**: Integration of the `uuid` module to generate unique 10-character Hexadecimal identifiers.
- **Automated QR Generation**: Dynamic QR code creation for every entry with an automated OS-level cleanup routine to maintain system hygiene.
- **Resilient UI**: Multi-layered input validation and confirmation loops to prevent data corruption.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Record Management**: Add, search, and delete records seamlessly via an interactive CLI.
- **Timestamps**: Each record includes a "Last saved" time for accurate tracking.
- **Educational Journey**: Built as part of my learning journey as a first-year undergraduate student, focusing on iterative improvement.
