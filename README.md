A lightweight CLI-based database management system built for structured data storage, unique ID generation, and QR code output. Designed as a learning project for a first-year undergraduate, this tool demonstrates OOP, JSON handling, and basic data validation.

🚀 **Features**
Persistent Storage: JSON-based storage ensures all records are saved and retrievable.

Unique ID Generation: Each record gets a 10-character hexadecimal ID using uuid.

QR Code Export: Display any user’s record as a QR code with easy deletion after viewing.

**Data Validation :**
Usernames cannot start/end with special characters or uppercase letters.

Names cannot have numbers, spaces, or special characters.

Interactive CLI Menu: Add, search, delete, or generate QR codes for users.

Safety Layer for Deletion: Confirms deletion for both individual users and the entire database to prevent mistakes.

✨ **Core Functions**

**name_enter()**
Add a new user with username, first & last name, and unique ID.

**search_name()**
Search users by username, full name, or ID.

**delete_data()**
Delete all records with confirmation.

**delete_person()**
Delete a single user’s data with confirmation.

**qr_code()**
Generate and display a QR code for any user record.

**file_load()**
Load existing records from lost.json.

**save_names()**
Save all records back to lost.json.


🛠️ **Usage**
Navigate through the menu to add users, search, generate QR codes, or delete data.

The QR code will be automatically deleted after you close it.

Deletion operations always require confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.
⚠️ **Limitations & Known Issues**
Username Validation: Special characters are checked only at start/end. Some edge cases may still bypass.

QR Code Display: Works on most systems but may fail on some non-GUI environments.

Error Handling: Minor exceptions are caught; however, incorrect manual file edits in lost.json may break loading.

Readme Generated by AI: Descriptions and technical highlights are AI-assisted; code is original.

💡 **Notes**
This project is a learning experiment, not for production use.

Code can be extended for integrations like payment systems, temporary storage, or data sharing via QR.
